**Cognizant Gen AI Externship - Capstone Project (Kundana Nittala)**

This repository contains the file for the Capstone Project: Personal Finance Tracker.

**About the project:**

The project involves creating an interactive tracker that takes user input to store, retrieve, and output information. When exceptions are found, a brief message is printed to inform the user of the issue.

Users who run this program will be presented with a welcome message and a menu of options (Adding Expenses, Viewing All Expenses, Viewing Summary, or Exit). 
From here, users are able to add as many expenses as they would like. Afterwards, by choosing viewing expenses or summary, category, description, and amount information can be organized and presented in totals.
